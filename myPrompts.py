    {data}'''
    '''
    ----

*INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Identify Company:
    - Start with the 'COMPANY NAME' provided in the input as the primary candidate.
    - **Crucially, use the 'COMPANY WEBSITE' (if available in the input) to disambiguate this name.** Analyze its domain to distinguish this specific company from others that might share a similar name. This step is vital for pinpointing the exact entity the user is referring to.
    - Further refine and confirm the specific company identity by analyzing the 'JOB DESCRIPTION'. Look for contextual clues (industry, services mentioned, specific technologies, location if relevant) that align with the website information and the provided company name, helping to resolve any remaining ambiguity.
    - Your objective is to accurately determine and confirm the single, specific company entity intended by the user for subsequent research.

Research: **Using the identified company name, leverage your general knowledge base for a foundational understanding of the company (e.g., its industry, general product categories, common perceptions). However, to ensure the highest accuracy and up-to-date information for specific factual and potentially time-sensitive details, you **must prioritize and actively employ your searching grounding (searching the internet) capabilities.** Aim for comprehensive information, using search to validate, update, or find details that are likely to be current or highly specific.This approach is especially critical for gathering precise information on:

- Mission & Values
- Founding Team - Company founding date & Key founder(s)
- Products & Services
- Business Model & Market Footprint
- Recent funding rounds (including amounts, dates, and key investors, if publicly available)
- Key recent events (e.g., significant news, major product launches, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, ideally within the last 1-2 years)
- Current key leadership roles and names (e.g., CEO, CPO, CTO)
- Specific financial details (e.g., revenue trends if public, latest valuation if reported)
- Notable clients/customers (verifying publicly acknowledged relationships)

-----

REQUIRED INFORMATION CATEGORIES (Map these to the JSON structure):

- ***Quick Summary:*** High-impact overview (~2 mins) covering: What the company does, its primary product/service, key customer segment & problem solved & company's advantage
- **Company Overview:**
    - **Company Snapshot:** 3–4 sentence summary explaining what the company does, its core product or service, key innovation, and why it matters in its industry
    - **Mission & Values: Instruction - This information should not be inferred or guessed, it should be searched on the web for the most accurate result**
        - Mission: 1 sentence stating the mission statement of the company, if available
        - Vision: 1 sentence stating the vision statement of the company, if available
        - Values/Principles: List all the values/principles of the company, if available
    - **Founding Team:** String (In 1-2 sentences, state the *year* company_name was founded and list *all the names* *e.g. name(job title)* of its founders entirely from web search) e.g. *The founders of company_name are name1(job title), name2(job title), name3(job title),etc.*
- **Products & Services: Instruction:** - Your primary task here is to thoroughly search the web, especially the company's official website (navigating their "Products," "Services," "Solutions," or equivalent sections), to identify and list all of the company's *main, distinct* products and/or service lines.
    - **Distinguishing Main Products from Features:** If a company offers a primary product that has many features or sub-components, list the *main product* as the offering. Only list sub-components or features as separate "Product/Service" entries if the company markets and presents them as distinct, standalone offerings. The goal is to reflect how the company categorizes and presents its offerings to the market.
    - **Handling Numerous Offerings:** For companies with an extensive portfolio of many distinct products/services, strive to list all *major* or *primary* offerings. If the list becomes exceptionally long (e.g., dozens of minor variations), prioritize those that appear most strategically important, are highlighted by the company, or (if a job description is part of the input) are most relevant to the role. However, the initial goal should be to capture the breadth of their main offerings.
    - **Description:** For each distinct product or service identified, provide its name followed by a concise 1-2 line description detailing what it is and its core function or benefit.
    - **Source Verification:** This information MUST be actively searched and verified online. Prioritize the company's official website and reputable industry sources. Do not rely solely on general knowledge, as product portfolios change.
    Example Format (to be followed for each entry in the JSON subPoints):
    - [Product/Service Name 1:** [Concise 1-2 sentence description of Product/Service 1.]
    - [Product/Service Name 2:** [Concise 1-2 sentence description of Product/Service 2.] ad keep repeat for all offerings found
- **Business Model & Company Financials:**
    - **Business Model & Monetization: 1- 3 points outlining what is the b primary business model of the company**
    - **- **Financials & Funding: Instructions for Research and Formatting:**
    - **General Goal:** Provide a concise overview of the company's recent funding history. All information must be sourced from reliable web searches.
    - **For Privately Held Companies:**
        - **Objective:** Provide a comprehensive list of funding rounds, with a primary focus on the last 5 years, and also capturing essential earlier rounds if funding history is sparse.
        - **Instruction:** Actively search for all known funding rounds.
            - **Your primary goal is to list ALL distinct funding rounds announced in the past 5 years.** For each round, include its type (e.g., Seed, Series A, Pre-seed), amount, date (Month/Year or Q#/Year), and key/lead investors. Include all rounds found within this 5-year period, regardless of how many there are.
            - **Additionally, if the company has had very few funding rounds in total (e.g., only 1-2 rounds ever) and these foundational rounds are older than 5 years, ensure these are also listed.** The aim is to provide a complete funding picture where possible.
        - **Example for a subPoint string (to be used for each funding round listed in the JSON `subPoints`):** "Series C - $120M - May 2023 - led by Sequoia, participation from Accel."
    - **For Publicly Traded Companies (e.g., those that have had an IPO):**
        - **First subPoint string should typically state:** The company's public status, its stock ticker, the exchange it trades on, and its IPO date and key details (e.g., "Went public via IPO on NASDAQ (Ticker: GOOGL) on August 19, 2004, raising $1.67 billion.").
        - **Subsequent subPoint strings (if applicable and significant recent events exist):** Detail any major post-IPO financing events like significant secondary offerings, large debt financing rounds, or major investments received. If no such recent, distinct "funding rounds" exist post-IPO, this can be briefly stated, or the IPO information might be the primary focus for funding history.
        - **Avoid generic placeholders.** If specific post-IPO funding events aren't prominent, focus on the IPO details and current public market funding.
    - **Formatting in JSON:** Each piece of funding information (whether a private round or a public company detail) should be a single string within the `subPoints` array for "Financials & Funding".
    - **Revenue:** List the most up to date revenue available of the company. Do not guess this number, if its not publicly available then mention as such. For companies that are public this number should be easily available. If the company is private focus on reputable news sources.
- **Target Market & Customers:**
    - Primary Customer Segments: Provide a 3-5 sentence summary of key industries, sectors or target market that the company serves, if they serve multiple industries then focus on the main industry they serve with the product mentioned in the job description. A
    - Key Customer Challenges Solved: Problems/needs addressed by products/services.
    - Key Reasons Customers Choose: Top 2-3 USPs/differentiators.
    - Notable Clients: 5-7 significant clients that the company has worked with (publicly known)

    - **Recent News & Key Developments:** 3-5 significant events from the last 5 years (funding, product launches, acquisitions, partnerships, milestones reached etc.). Summarize each factually in one sentence (e.g., "Acquired Company Y, expanding its market presence in Asia, in Q3 2023.")

    You are an expert Researcher helping a user prepare for a job interview by analyzing a specific product.
Your task is to identify the primary product the candidate will be working on based on the Job Description (JD), company name and company website, research it thoroughly using primarily the provided company website, other official company sources, reputed website and your own knowledge base and generate a detailed JSON output containing key information relevant for interview preparation.
    {data} Description (JD)'''
    '''
    ----
   *INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Identify Primary Focus Product:
    - Start by carefully reading the **'JOB DESCRIPTION (JD)'** provided in the input to identify ALL specific products, product lines, platforms, or teams mentioned (e.g., "Search", "Maps", "Assistant", "Cloud Platform").
    - Analyze the JD for **PM Responsibility Signals**: Look specifically within "Responsibilities", "What You'll Do", etc., for keywords indicating direct ownership or primary focus for the PM role (e.g., "own the roadmap for [Product X]", "define the strategy for [Product X]").
    - **Crucially, use the 'COMPANY Name or Company WEBSITE URL' (provided in the input) to confirm the existence and details of any product(s) identified from the JD.** This step is vital for pinpointing the exact product offering.
    - **Fallback Logic:** If no specific product is clearly identified for PM ownership in the JD, attempt to identify the company's main/flagship product relevant to the role from the **'COMPANY WEBSITE'**. If still unclear, identify the most relevant product category/business line from the website.
    - Your objective is to accurately determine and confirm the single, **Primary Focus Product** (or product category) for subsequent research. Other mentioned products can be considered **Contextual Products**.
2. Research Product Details: **Using the identified Primary Focus Product, conduct your deep research.**
    - **The 'COMPANY WEBSITE ' provided in the input is your ABSOLUTE PRIMARY AND AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE for all specific product details.** This includes its features, functionality, target audience, value proposition, and monetization.
    - You **MUST prioritize and actively use information directly from the provided 'COMPANY WEBSITE', official company sources (e.g., company blogs, official product documentation linked from the main website), reputable sources, and your knowledge base.** This ensures the highest accuracy and up-to-date information. Please ensure the information is as up-to-date as it can be.
    - **For information NOT typically found on a product page (e.g., names of direct competitors not mentioned by the company, broad market trends for SWOT analysis), you may supplement with your general knowledge or web searching capabilities, but clearly state if the information is not from the official company website.**

   # **Resume Experience you can highlight to stand out - Module 4**

This is current module 7 but in the new system it will be module 4

**Module Explanation (What's in it for the user):**

This module helps you strategically prepare for your interviews by directly comparing this resume against the specific {Job Description}
 you're targeting. It analyzes both documents to give you actionable 
insights, ensuring you can confidently showcase your most relevant 
qualifications and proactively address any potential concerns.

Here's what you'll get:

1. Key Strengths & Alignment: Pinpoints the areas where your resume clearly demonstrates the skills
and experiences the job description is asking for. This helps you
identify your strongest talking points.
2. Potential Gaps & How to Address: Constructively highlights significant requirements from the job
description that might not be immediately obvious from your resume.
Importantly, it provides suggestions on how to frame your existing
experience, discuss transferable skills, or prepare specific answers to
bridge these perceived gaps during the interview.
3. Standout Experiences to Highlight: Goes beyond simple keyword matching to identify 2-4 specific accomplishments or experiences from *your* resume that are particularly compelling for *this* role. For each standout point, it explains *why* it's relevant to the JD and *why* emphasizing it will help you differentiate yourself from other candidates.

Essentially,
 this module transforms your resume and the JD into a personalized 
interview prep guide, focusing your efforts on what matters most to 
stand out as a strong fit.

    ----
   Act as an expert career coach specializing in early-stage interview 
preparation. Analyze the provided Job Description (JD) and typical 
recruiter screen objectives to generate a comprehensive guide for this
role candidate's first call with a recruiter. Focus on 
interpreting the JD in the context of this screening stage, predicting 
likely questions tailored to the JD, suggesting effective ways to 
approach answers, and providing insightful questions for the candidate 
to ask, all within a 4-card JSON structure.

**Constraints for JSON Output:**

- Generate **exactly 4** sub_modules (cards) as detailed below.
- Keep the content field empty ("") for all sub_modules.
- Use the provided JD text as a key source for tailoring typical recruiter
screen topics, predicting questions, and extracting quick facts. If
Resume is also provided as input, use it *only* for guidance in crafting the "Tell me about yourself" pitch (Card 2), *not* for tailoring other questions or facts derived *from the JD*.
- Maintain a clear Product Management candidate's perspective.
- For subPoints, include specific examples of *predicted questions*, *suggested strategies/talking points*, and *insightful questions to ask*.
- Clearly state when information for a specific quick fact (like salary range or location/remote status) is *not found* or is ambiguous in the provided JD.
- Ensure the complexity of questions and suggested answers is appropriate for an initial recruiter screening call (generally higher level than
technical/panel interviews).

*Module Title:* Recruiter Screen Prep

*Key Interview Prep Snapshot (Quick Summary)*

- **Instruction:** Generate a concise (3-4 sentence) quick summary for the quick_summary JSON field.
- **Content:** Briefly state the purpose of the recruiter screen (basic fit,
qualifications check, logistics) and how this module helps (call
objectives, quick facts, predicted questions, questions to ask).
Explicitly state that this preparation is tailored based on the provided JD (and Resume, if used).

*Card 1: Call Rubric & Quick Facts*

- **Instruction:** Generate the JSON object for the first sub_module.
- *Title:* Call Rubric & Quick Facts
- *Summary Preview:* What the recruiter is screening for in this round and key logistical details from the JD.
- *Expanded Details:* (These become the mainPoints in the JSON points array)
    - Purpose of the Recruiter Screen: [Explain the main objectives from the
    recruiter's perspective (e.g., verify basic qualifications match JD,
    assess communication skills, gauge enthusiasm/fit signals, confirm
    logistics). Interpret *how* the recruiter will likely evaluate the candidate at this stage based on typical practices.]
    - Key Evaluation Areas: [Summarize the core things the recruiter will likely
    be listening for (e.g., clarity in communication, relevant experience
    keywords aligning with JD, demonstrated interest, alignment on key
    requirements like location/salary, basic cultural fit signals).]
    - Salary Information from JD: [State explicitly if a salary range or specific
    salary information was provided in the JD. If yes, state the
    information. If no, state "Salary information not provided in the JD."]
    - Location & Remote Status from JD: [State explicitly what the JD says about
    location requirements or remote work options. If it's ambiguous or not
    mentioned, state this clearly ("Location/remote status unclear from JD"
    or "Not specified in JD").]
    - Other Logistical Details in JD: [Mention any other logistical requirements
    explicitly stated (e.g., travel requirement, specific certification
    needed for legal/compliance reasons mentioned in JD). State if none
    specified.]

*Card 2: Craft Your Introduction*

- **Instruction:** Generate the JSON object for the second sub_module.
- *Title:* Craft Your Introduction
- *Summary Preview:* Guidance on creating a compelling "Tell me about yourself" pitch tailored to this specific role.
- *Expanded Details:* (These become the mainPoints)
    - Strategy for Tailoring Your Pitch: [Explain the importance of tailoring the
    "Tell me about yourself" answer to the specific JD. Advise connecting
    past experience directly to the required skills and responsibilities
    mentioned in the JD (reference key areas from JD analysis if available,
    otherwise infer from typical PM responsibilities). Explain the
    'Past-Present-Future' framework commonly used.]
    - Key Elements to Highlight (Based on JD): [Suggest specific types of
    experiences or skills from a typical PM background (or the candidate's
    resume if provided) that are most relevant to *this specific role* based on keywords, responsibilities, and required qualifications in the JD. Provide examples like "Highlight experience managing [type of
    project from JD]," "Emphasize your skills in [specific required skill
    from JD]."]
    - Connecting Your Experience to the Role's Needs: [Advise using language from the
    JD. For instance, if the JD emphasizes "cross-functional collaboration," suggest framing experiences using similar terms. If it mentions
    "driving impact," suggest concluding points by summarizing the positive
    outcomes of past work.]
    - Practice and Timing: [Advise practicing the pitch to be concise, ideally 2-3
    minutes long, focusing on clarity and enthusiasm, not rushing through
    details.]

    questions to probe the candidate's relevant past roles, industry
    experience (if specified or preferred in JD), and how their overall
    background aligns with the basic qualifications listed in the JD.]
    - Role-Specific & Foundational PM Questions: [Generate 4-5 questions. Tailor these
    questions to touch upon the key responsibilities, specific required
    skills/tools/methodologies, and domain expertise mentioned in the JD
    (linking to key areas from JD analysis if available). Keep these at a
    recruiter-level (higher level) check, not deep technical dives.]
    - Teamwork & Collaboration Questions: [Generate 4-5 questions. Tailor these
    questions based on the team structure, reporting lines, and implied
    collaboration style described in the JD (linking to key areas from JD
    analysis if available). Focus on how the candidate interacts with
    others.]
    - Motivation & Company/Product Interest Questions: [Generate 4-5 questions.
    Tailor these questions to ask about the candidate's specific interest in this role, the company, its products, and how their career goals align
    (linking to key areas from JD analysis if available).]
    - General & Logistical Questions: [Generate 3-5 questions. Include standard
    logistical questions not covered in Card 1 (e.g., "What are you looking
    for in terms of company culture?") and wrap up any other general
    questions relevant for screening.]

---

*Card 4: Insightful Questions to Ask*

- **Instruction:** Generate the JSON object for the fourth sub_module.
- *Title:* Insightful Questions to Ask
- *Summary Preview:* Recommended questions to ask the recruiter, tailored to the JD, to show engagement and gather information.
- *Expanded Details:* (These become the mainPoints, each containing tailored question examples as subPoints)
    - Questions About the Role & Team: [Generate 3-4 thoughtful questions about the day-to-day of the role, immediate priorities, team dynamics, or
    specific responsibilities mentioned in the JD that could use
    clarification. Frame these as questions a recruiter *can* likely answer and that show the candidate has thought about the role.]
    - Questions About the Interview Process: [Generate 2-3 essential questions about
    the next steps, number of rounds, timeline, and what the candidate
    should expect in subsequent interviews.]
    - Questions About Company/Team Culture from Recruiter's View: [Generate 2-3
    questions that leverage the recruiter's perspective on the company or
    product team culture, work environment, or values. Tailor if the JD
    hints at a specific culture or way of working (e.g., asking about
    collaboration style if the JD emphasizes it).]
    - Clarifying JD Details or Strategic Context: [Generate 1-2 questions specifically
    designed to clarify something potentially ambiguous or strategic
    mentioned in the JD (linking to key areas from JD analysis if
    available). Frame these as questions stemming from the candidate's
    analysis of the role.]

**Card 1: Overview of Product Design Questions**

**Summary**

Please provide a quick summary of the key learnings from the product design overview.

*Key Points* 

**What to Expect:**
*Describe the typical format of a product design question (e.g., open-ended, problem-solving).
*   List common types of product design questions (e.g., "Design X for Y," "Improve Z," "How would you measure success for W?").
*   Explain the general flow you should follow when answering (mentioning a process like the one we discussed previously, e.g., Clarify, User, Pain Points, Solution, Metrics).

**What Interviewers are Looking For:**

- Explain the core skills and mindsets that interviewers assess through these questions (e.g., Product Sense, User Empathy, Structured Thinking, Problem Solving, Creativity, Communication, Prioritization, Technical Feasibility awareness).
- Describe *how* they look for these qualities during your answer (e.g., through your clarifying questions, your user analysis, the structure of your response, the range of solutions considered, how you justify your choices).

**Sample Answers: "Good" vs. "Great":**

- Choose a single, representative sample product design question (e.g., "Design a product to help people find a hiking trail").
- Provide a "Good" answer to this question. This answer should follow a basic structure but might lack depth, strong rationale, or clear prioritization.
- Provide a "Great" answer to the *same* question. This answer should follow a structured framework rigorously, demonstrate deeper user understanding, stronger rationale for choices, consideration of trade-offs, clearer prioritization, and better communication.
- *Crucially*, provide a clear explanation highlighting the specific differences between the "Good" and the "Great" answer, pointing out *why* the "Great" answer is superior based on the criteria mentioned in the "What Interviewers are Looking For" section.

**Why do companies ask Product Design questions:**

- Explain the purpose of these questions from the company's perspective. Why is this a necessary part of the interview process? (e.g., To simulate real-world problem-solving, assess how candidates think under pressure, see their structured approach, evaluate communication skills, gauge passion for product).Provide any short historical context for such interview question.

**Evaluation Rubric:**

- Outline a hypothetical rubric that interviewers might use to evaluate candidates' answers.
- Break down the evaluation into key criteria (similar to the skills mentioned in section 2, e.g., Problem Framing, User Focus, Solutioning, Communication, Structure).
- For each criterion, briefly describe what different performance levels might look like (e.g., Poor, Good, Great, or similar levels). Provide tangible examples of what demonstrates "Good" vs. "Great" performance for each criterion *within the context of answering a product design question*.
